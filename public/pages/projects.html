            FoodDex was made with the intention to be an online food/recipe wall. With use of libraries such

            description, and recipe for everyone to view. It is also equipped with a useful search bar
            with the ability to search without specifics. This was a group project with Mick taking on

            This RPG game has a Harry Potter theme that allows a player to choose a character and battle those
            of the opposing side. This project is reliant on jQuery, JS, HTML, and CSS to provide an experience
            with shielding, healing, and back and forth attacking. This has many moving parts and is still
            very nice to the eye.
